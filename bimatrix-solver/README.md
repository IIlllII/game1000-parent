Bimatrix solver
----------------------------------
This is a port of parts of the code from:
https://github.com/gambitproject/gte

It contains a solver for bimatrix games, using the Lemkw Hawson
algorithm and some changes for thread safety, plus some extensions
for simpler use, and serialization.

Since (https://github.com/gambitproject/gte)[gte] is GPL v3 licensed, 
so is this.
